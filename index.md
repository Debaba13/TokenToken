## The TokenToken(TNTN) Project

The aim of TokenToken(TNTN) Project is to educate people of all backgrounds on tokenomics and especially IERC20 and IERC721, interfaces required to create NFTs and Regular Tokens.

Crypto is a dynamic world. Information available on public platforms technical documents such as PancakeSwap, Sushiswap, Uniswap or OpenZeppelin is plentiful, yet gibberish to any regular human. Today, any crypto savvy individual can use these platforms to profit, without understanding the working logic behind it. But is this truly the right or the safe way? 

TNTN attempts to solve this by creating a community for the users of DeFi that are not software engineers.

INTRODUCING TNTN

TokenToken is a token created on Polygon(MATIC) blockchain that has a supply of 160 Million that it will transfer to community in its entirety, that means no possibility of exit scam or rugpulling, as the developer team does not possess any funds from the start.

100 addressess right now hold 100 Million $TNTN, each having 1 Million $TNTN. Each one of these addresses will distribute tokens, 80 of addresses will distribute to people on Twitter directly on a first come first serve basis, giving the first entry address 100 thousand $TNTN, second 50 thousand $TNTN and the third 25 thousand $TNTN. Every consequent entry will receive 10 thousand $TNTN.

10 of the addresses will be given to 10 accounts holding the most amount of $TNTN at the end of NOV 2021.

10 of the addresses will be given randomly to 10 people that holds any amount of $TNTN.

The token charges 5 percent holders fee and 1 percent automatic LP fee per transaction, incentivizing hodling and community building that results from it.
